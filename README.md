# Game-CV-Simu: CV Aim-Assist

Two projects:
- TrexAI: starter project for applying cv into game-play
- Game_Plugin: using state-of-the-art model to achieve real-time in-game enemy detection and aim assist.

This project is an interest to extend my computer vision knowledge and programming skills into a game task. It is an attempt and it demenstrates the performance of relative techniques. It shows that running a CV aimbot with a large model along with mainstream video games is possible on a home desktop.
